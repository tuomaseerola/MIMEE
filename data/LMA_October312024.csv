I noted in the task guidelines that you wishes to avoid negative items and so have focused on positive phrasings. I completely agree with that approach, and so an item rating the extent to which the music was UNrelated to how the listener felt in that moment feels more negative in my reading it.

That feels more consistent with the positivist orientation, at least in my reading.",Extremely Relevant,,Moderately Relevant,,Moderately Relevant,,Extremely Relevant,,Extremely Relevant,"I feel this item is relevant, but perhaps overlap quite substantially with a similarly phrased item (""I was preoccupied with more important things than music"").

For instance, focusing on small details could relate to aspects of composition, instrumentation, vocal, and melodic content. I could plausibly feel a stronger emotional connection to a piece of music by, for example, paying closer attention to a specific set of lyrics or by focusing on a particular melody.

Overall, these are the main terms / themes that emerged for me in Listening Mode & Agency: 

Diffuse - 'attention', music as 'background music'
Bodily - 'moving to the beat', 'dance'
Emotional - 'experiences', 'reminisce' 
Associative - 'visual imagery', 'thoughts'
Structural - 'details', 'anticipating'
Reduced / Causal - (unsure and seems to overlap a bit with Structural)

Tying back to the description of 'Listening modes & Agency' in the guide document: 

(1) I think the 'Agency' part is somewhat missing - like is it my personal choice to listen to this specific piece of music now in this current context? Or is it I am subjected to this music because I am in the supermarket, out in the restaurant where there's some background music playing and I have no control over it? Or maybe I am hanging out with my friends and I don't get to choose the music to listen to - it may depend more on group agreement?

(2) Bodily - I think most of the items are asking if the music made you (physically) move. How about an urge to move but you didn't actually move along (like just small groovin' movements?)

(3) From the doc: "".. common types of attention for music listening"" - I think this can benefit from a quick dive into the Attention literature to look into different types of attention (e.g. focused attention, sustained attention, divided attention etc)

Lastly, just wondering if there would be a component that measures listening alone vs listening with others? This to me sounds like it would be under Listening modes (although it may appear elsewhere in DEEM). ",HNTU,Singaporean

Is this blending on purpose? i.e. there is a theoretical reason to imply multiple modes of listening occurring simultaneously? If there is, are all combinations accounted for?",Extremely Relevant,,Extremely Relevant,,Moderately Relevant,,Extremely Relevant,,Extremely Relevant,,Extremely Relevant,,Extremely Relevant,,Extremely Relevant,an example of a change in listening modes,Extremely Relevant,,Extremely Relevant,,Not Relevant,It doesn't seem to capture a specific mode of listening.

I have three comments: one comment regarding the emotional listening construct, a second regarding the interaction between constructs, and a third regarding better operationalising agency within each construct.

First, the emotional listening mode appears to capture the emergence of emotional listening appearing in a listener’s/player's conscious experience. However, they do not appear to refer to the intensity or control of the emotional experience with music as per the description. For example, statements like ‘my emotions changed’ is certainly indicative of someone listening emotionally, but dose not capture the emotional intensity or the degree of agency a listener exerts in focusing on emotional listening over other modes. Is it assumed that emotional listening inherently involves more intense emotions, or should this be assessed separately? My point here is not that every statement must capture all these elements simultaneously, but that additional examples that also focus on the degree of intensity and the degree of agency should also be included.

Second, I have highlighted some items that suggest an interaction between multiple modes of listening. However, most of the overlaps appear to coincide with an emotionally focused listening mode, while other example appear scarce. For example, diffuse & bodily listening modes: a listener may not be consciously focusing on the music (diffuse), but their body might still unconsciously move or respond to the rhythm (bodily). Alternatively, associative & structural models of listening could overlap: a listener can reflect on the structural elements of the music, such as recognising themes or motifs, while simultaneously allowing those structural elements to prompt associations or guide imagery.
It is of course possible to argue that these interactions will be captured by identifying robust measures for individual constructs and seeing in what ways they vary together or not. Yet, if this is the case, it is likely better to remove items where construct overlap could be ambiguously interpreted.

Third, the degree of agency there is in each construct appears to favour less agency in most cases. These are typically phrased towards music as the causes the construct, but do not suggest that the individual has much control it. For example, 'the music produced vivid images', this can involve examples where the listener automatically envisions a scene, even if they didn't set out to imagine anything in particular. However, individuals may use music to assist in visualising a scene, and may actively control the details and progression of this mental imagery - like in meditation or as an aid to story writing. The point here is not to focus on what the image is, this seems better captured by the 'Musical Meanings' scheme, but the degree of control one has over it. Another example might be the degree of agency in structural listening, that likely correlates with the degree of musical training.
Another aspect of agency worth noting is that there appears to be no assessment of the degree of agency individuals have over changing between modes of listening. There are example items where the music changers the mode of listening (less agency), but not of the listener actively changing focus by choice. For example, my bodily focused mode of listening changed to diffuse as I got tired of dancing.",TML,British
