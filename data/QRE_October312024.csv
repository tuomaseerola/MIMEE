This seems like it describes knowledge of reward from music, but better captures the degree of motivational relevance an individual places on music generally. As well as suggesting the individual wants a strong degree of agency in their music selection",Extremely Relevant,,Extremely Relevant,,Extremely Relevant,,Slightly Relevant,,Moderately Relevant,,Extremely Relevant,,"With regard to the 4 constructs in the scheme, there appears to be more that could be added to capture the multi-dimensionality of each. 

Exposure: this appears to capture more of the examples where exposure has occurred and is important in building liking. However, the alternative end to this dimensions is neglected - 'Novelty'. The perception of change in stimuli and the reward of finding something new are most certainly tied to novelty evaluations. Similarly, I would argue that a greater focus on 'Goal-congruence' would help better capture this construct. The ""reward of finding something new"" aligns with an appraisal of whether the novelty is congruent with the individual's goals - whether encountering something new serves a positive, rewarding function.

Phrased more simply, a greater focus on exposure to novel experiences is a valuable and form of exposure in its self.

Familiarity: is logically very closely tied to the above comments for exposure. However, given the operational definition in the documents, I would add that familiarity here should be expanded to capture the 'anticipation of reward' either as cognitive, emotional, or physical reward.

Preference: seems very tied into the degree of goal-congruence a stimuli has based on previous experience. The examples here seem to miss the range of congruence to non-congruence that a stimuli could be assessed as i.e. developing disliking though previous exposure to non-congruent stimuli.

Physical Reactions: Bodily experiences can be a focus of appraisal themselves - 'embodied appraisal'. In reference to the above comments I would suggest that bodily sensations are appraisal as part of 'Exposure' be this a novel bodily sensation or a familiar one. Preference too for certain bodily sensations might build over time or vary by situational context. Finally, there is the degree of 'coping potential' regarding physical responses. For example, some physical responses may not always be desired. Crying for instance, while often pleasant, might be non-congruent with the context or be negatively overwhelming in emotionally. Overexposure might physically manifest itself as fatigue, boredom, or irritation. Or familiarity and exposure too a disliked genre of music might build physical experiences of tension.

I hope these comments are helpful in trying to operationalise these constructs and help to capture the inherent interrelatedness between them.

I would add more items about mere exposure. E.g.: 
""The more I listened to this music, the more I liked it.""

Add some negative items about familiarity and values. E.g.:
""I disliked the music because it was new to me (or because I was unfamiliar with the music)""
""I disliked the music because it clashes with my personal values""


Finally, this may overlap with other categories, but I think the questionnaire could look into other sources of reward in music. For instance, finding that listening to a particular piece of music is rewarding because...
- It is intellectually challenging, difficult to understand, etc.
- It brings back personal memories
- It helps the listener to dance
- It helps the listener to achieve a non-musical goal. Eg. exercising with a steady rhythm, forget unwanted thoughts, covering noise, achieving concentration, relaxing, feeling part of a cultural elite, etc.
