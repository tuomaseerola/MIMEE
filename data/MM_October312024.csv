First: Lyrics are clearly presented in relation to self-meaning and some what in social-meaning, but could be more equally represented across the three types of meaning. For instance, in structural-meaning items that focus is on how the lyrical content interacts with musical elements (e.g., rhythm, phrasing, and harmony) and/or how it fits or contrasts with the overall musical composition. 

With regard to social-meaning, lyrics relating to the broader cultural, historical, or sociopolitical ideas are there. However, these could be expanded to capture ideas such as lyrics challenge or reinforce social norms, offering critique or support of cultural practices; the lyrics empower the listener, reflecting the persona or advocacy of the artist, giving a sense of agency or social power; or lyrics could reflect collective experiences or shared social causes, influencing social bonds.

Second: I have made one comment under a single item that appears to capture a lack of meaning, instead of referring to a specified musical-meaning construct. My suggestion is to include specific examples of lack of meaning, or inability to grasp meaning even when trying for each construct individually. I explicitly suggest these two ideas (inability to find meaning, and searching for meaning) be separated out. This will allow for individual motivations to find meaning and predispositions towards identifying certain types of meaning are not confused.

For example, with the musical structure construct items that reflect a lack of meaning could included ""I felt lost when listening to music because I didn't understand its structure"". Similarly the self construct might be ""I struggle to find personal connections to songs I hear (on the radio / for the first time.)"", or ""I rarely find songs that resonate with my personal experiences.""

Third: Some items appear to reflect different degrees of 'depth of meaning' with regard to the complexity or emotional richness they reference. For example, the difference between an important and personal memory, as opposed to, being reminded of someone you know possibly not particularly well. 

I was wondering if this was considered during the operationalisation of these constructs. While the degree of emotional depth any individual has with a piece of music would appear to be captured by simply identifying how many types of musical meaning a participant identifies as important, without acknowledging that certain items may reference a greater degree of depth of meaning than others may skew the results.

For items in Self, one interesting aspect that could be included is scenarios whereby sometimes an individual's private listening persona may differ as compared to a public persona due to peer or social affiliations (e.g. I like to listen to Classical music in private but may agree to go to a Rock music concert because my friends go to these concerts). This concept may have been covered in Group cohesion / socialization.

For items in 'Source', generally I think it is a matter of how much you want to distinguish between a composer's actual intent for the music vs how the performer interprets it - that could affect the construction of some items.
