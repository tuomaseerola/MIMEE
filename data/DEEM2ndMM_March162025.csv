My reading of self-meaning, as per the description, is that it emphasises personal connections/connotations (e.g., autobiographical memories) into the emotional experience relating to that piece of music. The items I have left out, therefore, feel somewhat distinct from this because they could plausibly relate to music the listener has no prior experience with, and hence it may not be exclusive to this particular construct (e.g., I might recognise something of myself reflected in a piece of music, but this does not necessarily mean I have an intense emotional reaction to that because, as yet, I have not had the time to build a strong personal connection). 

In addition, the items I've listed in positions 1 and 2, relating to past experiences or a certain time in my life, I wonder whether these could be condensed into one item?

(a) The harmony and / or melody of the music brought about a certain feeling in me -> note: refer directly to harmony and/or melody, and its common associations with valence
(b) My level of alertness was related to the tempo of the music -> note: refer directly to tempo of music (or speed if preferred), and its common associations with arousal level
(c) I enjoyed the instruments I heard in the music -> note: refer to timbre aspect, which may affect the valence experienced
(d) I feel that the music is trying to tell a story through its different musical features  -> note: this is a little similar to a current item that asks about imagery, but it reframes it to directly attribute the experience to musical features, instead of the experience being evoked as a result of the musical imagery (and hence not directly the musical features)
(e) I liked the brightness of the music -> note: also a timbre aspect 

Other comments of current items: 
(1) I was important to me that the music developed in a certain way -> typo of I instead of ""It""
(2) The music expressed something that I could not express in words -> This does not capture the essence of structural information in the music. 
(3) I made sense of what the music meant through images and / or stories in my mind -> This is more of a musical imagery question - I'm not sure how directly relevant it is to musical elements themselves? Perhaps: The music seems to be conveying a story or painting a picture

One minor comment to an existing item:

Other comments for existing items:
(1) I conformed to my peers musical preferences -> I think this statement is in itself valid, but may be more applicable to the function of Connection-Belonging instead of this construct. 
(2) I chose to listen to music because it resonated with my personal values -> consider adding ""the music"" instead of just ""music""
