I did not feel that 'being moved' came across strongly in the items. There was something about strong emotion, but it lacked a bit of specificity (again a bit too general)?

In my opinion, there are 2 items that seem construct-irrelevant to me (please see points 7, 8 below):

(1) I wanted to feel energized by the music -> In my personal opinion, I think this statement is technically valid, but may not be very applicable to the specific feeling of energized. This is because in most cases, music has been found to be rather effective in increasing arousal across a variety of context. It is the valence aspect that is a bit more tricky, so I would think something like ""I wanted to feel more happy from listening to the music"" may make more sense. 
(2) The music helped me manage my level of energy -> I think this statement in itself is valid, but here it becomes non-directional (you can also use the music to help make you feel more calm), which I think is a bit outside the concept of FM. 
(3) I slowed down my energy with the music -> ""slowed down my energy"" does not seem very intuitive - isn't it the equivalence of being more relaxed? 
(4) The music helped me to moderate my energy -> consider adding in ""level"" after energy; ie … moderate my energy level. 
(5) I wanted the music to stimulate my energy -> ""stimulate my energy"" sounds a bit awkward, consdier ""stimulate me"", or ""stimulate my level of alertness""
(6) Music helped me focus on what I was doing -> this item assumes that the individual uses the music as background music. Note there may be cases that individuals listen first to music then start on their task (without the music)
(7) ** The music let me focus on the present moment -> This statement does not tell you much about whether it helped to improve focus and motivation (usually to do something). It could be leaning towards the music helping you to become more mindful and present. 
(8) ** Being motivated by the music felt productive -> This logic is a bit weird to me. Do people really feel productive because they were being motivated by the music? I would think they feel productive because they managed to accomplish the thing they want to do, which is achieved with the help of music motivating them
(9) I was more focused while listening to the music -> Consider to add in a reference to a task: I was more focused ""on my task"" while listening to the music
(10) The music reduced my motivation -> Consider also to add in a reference to a task: The music reduced my motivation ""to complete my task""

Both these 2 points have some overlap with PEP episode. Perhaps CB episode can be kept to interpersonal connection (instead of a mix of inter- and intrapersonal connection)?

(1) I felt more connected with other people because of the music -> consider ""through"" the music?
(2) The music made me feel more connected to a group -> ""group"" is vague here - and also does the importance of the group matter (eg family vs strangers)
(3) I felt connected with people who also listen to this music -> is it important to differentiate between this PARTICULAR music, or any music in this genre or by this artist?
(4) Sharing the music with others enhancement my enjoyment -> while this statement in and of itself is valid, I don't think brings out the essence of connection / social bonding
(5) The music made me feel connected to my peers or family -> perhaps to consider further separating into one item for peers, another for family. This is because the music that makes you feel connected to your peers may not (as perhaps would be quite common and even more so for youths) be the same as those that connect you to your family. But this is an important question in my opinion. 
(6) I thought of sharing this music with my peers -> personally, I don't think this question brings out the function of music in connection / bonding. Because one could think of sharing a particular music with a friend, but there is a variety of reasons behind that which may not just be about connecting to a friend in a meaningful way.
(7) The music disconnected me from the group -> Don't personally like the structure of the sentence, but I think the message of this item is conveyed in the next item: ""The music made me feel excluded from the group""
(8) The music let me express how I felt about someone -> I think this item is more related to the emotional communication / regulation aspect of the music itself, rather than connection or belonging. Also, consider: the music ""allows me to"" express how I felt about someone
(9) I felt spiritually connected to other people that listen to this music -> Is it important to include ""spiritually"" here? What if an individual isn't generally spiritual at all?
(10) The music made me feel like someone understood me -> Again, I feel like this is more a mood-regulation question than a CB question. 
(11) I shared the listening experience with others -> This looks like it has some missing words, perhaps ""I enjoyed sharing the listening experience with others""?
(12) The music felt like a friend who understood my worries -> This also looks more inclined as a mood-regulation question than focus on CB.

(2) The music allowed me to escape from my daily routines -> must it be ""daily routines""? How about making it more specific to the EDR construct, eg. Escape from ""my problems""?
(3) The music momentarily disconnected me from my surroundings -> consider ""distracted"" instead of ""disconnected
(4) ** The music stopped me from being able to relax -> I think this statement is a bit vague, because the reasons for the response could be very varied, e.g. maybe the music made me more energetic / maybe I didn't like the music etc, and therefore an answer to this statement does not relate directly back to EDR.

(1) I navigated the feelings by controlling the music -> This statement does not appear very logical to me
(2) The music made me feel secure -> I'm not sure how feeling secure it directly related to PEP?
(3) I controlled my feelings by processing them through the music -> In my opinion, I don't think people consciously 'control their feelings' 
(4) The experience made me aware of how I can express myself while listening to music -> I think this sentence can be less complicated, e.g. I became more aware of how I can express myself as I listened to music / Listening to the music empowered me to better express myself
